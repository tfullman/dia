Description: Implements the Development Impacts Analysis (DIA) model described
    in Fullman et al. (in press) Ecosphere. The DIA quantifies potential
    impacts of future development while accounting for uncertainty in development
    location. It simulates development under different scenarios and quantifies
    impacts to species.
