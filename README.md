# `dia` package

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The `dia` package implements the Development Impacts Analysis (DIA)
model described in Fullman et al.Â (2021). The DIA
quantifies potential impacts of future development while accounting for
uncertainty in development location. This is done through simulation of
development under different management scenarios with quantification of
the resulting impacts to species.

The workhorse of the `dia` package is the `dia` function. For an example
of its use please see the function documentation.

## Installation

To install the latest version of `dia` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tfullman/dia")
```
